                The Faisal Mosque is the national mosque of Pakistan, located in capital Islamabad. It is the
                fifth-largest
                mosque in the world and the largest within South Asia, located on the foothills of Margalla Hills in
                Pakistan's
                capital city of Islamabad. It is named after the late King Faisal I of Saudi Arabia. The mosque features
                a
                contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired by the design of a
                typical
                Bedouin tent. A major tourist attraction in Pakistan, the mosque is a contemporary and influential piece
                of
                Islamic architecture. Construction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $28 million grant from Saudi King
                Faisal,
                whose name the mosque bears. The unconventional design by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay was selected
                after an
                international competition. Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded
                by four
                260 feet tall minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular
                worship
                hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers. Combined the structure covers an area of 33 acres, the mosque
                dominates
                the landscape of Islamabad. To see the location of Shah Faisal Masjid <a

                The Pakistan Monument is a national monument and heritage museum located on the western
                Shakarparian Hills in Islamabad, Pakistan. The monument was constructed to symbolize the unity of the
                Pakistani
                people. It is dedicated to the people of Pakistan who sacrificed their "today" for a better "tomorrow".
                The four
                large petals represent each of the four main cultures of Pakistan, the Punjabi, the Balochi, the Sindhi
                and the
                Pakhtun. The three smaller petals represent: the minorities, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Its
                elevation
                makes the monument visible from across the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area and is a popular
                tourist
                destination.

                The plan for a National Monument was first envisioned in 2002 by the government of Pakistan then
                assisted by Uxi
                Mufti, son of Mumtaz Mufti. The Ministry of Culture was tasked to organize through Pakistan Council of
                Architects and Town Planners; a national monument design competition based on the theme of signifying
                strength. To see the location of Pakistan Monument
