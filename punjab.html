        Punjab is the largest province in population and the second largest province in physical size in Pakistan. In
        2017, 1.75 million tourists visited Pakistan according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.

        It is known for its ancient cultural heritage as well as its religious diversity. The lands of Punjab have been
        home to a number of religions and civilisations. The Indus Valley civilization once ruled the region and a
        significant archaeological find was discovered at the ancient city of Harrapa. The Gandhara civilisation was
        also quite dominant in the northern region of Punjab at the site of Taxila. Several other civilisations such as
        Greeks, Central Asians, and Persians ruled Punjab leaving a number of sites which still exist today. The arrival
        of Islam came about during the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate (arrival of Muhammad bin Qasim in early 8th
        century) followed by the Ghaznavids. The Mughals took control of the region later and ruled its land for several
        centuries. The mughal heritage remained quite strong in Punjab with a large number of forts, tombs and monuments
        still intact today.

        The Durrani Empire ruled the Punjab at the fall of the Mughal Empire for a short period followed by the rise of
        the Sikh Empire in the 19th century. The strong control of the Sikhs also led to a number of sites still
        remaining intact throughout Punjab. The British Raj took control of the region until the independence of British
        India in 1947.

        cosmopolitan cities in Punjab. The provincial capital, Lahore is the second largest city of Pakistan as is known

        Jahangir and Nur Jahan, Tomb of Asaf Khan and Chauburji are other major sites visited by tourists each year. The

        Lahore. The Samadhi of Ranjit Singh and Hazuri Bagh Baradari are prime example of Sikh architecture during the
        rule of the Sikh Empire. There a number of other sites within Lahore such as Minar-e-Pakistan, Lahore Museum,

                The Badshahi Mosque is a Mughal-era congregational mosque in Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province
                of
                Punjab. The mosque is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of Lahore, and
                is
                widely considered to be one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks. The Badshahi Mosque was constructed by
                the Mughal
                emperor Aurangzeb between 1671 and 1673 and was the largest mosque in the world from 1673 to 1986. The
                mosque is
                an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red
                sandstone with
                marble inlay. It remains the largest mosque of the Mughal-era, and is the third-largest mosque in
                Pakistan.
                After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a garrison by the British Empire, and is now
                one of
                Pakistan's most iconic sights. To see the location of Badshahi Masjid <a

                The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern
                end of
                walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments,
                some of
                which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely
                rebuilt in
                the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence. Though the
                site of the
                Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was
                regarding an 11th-century mud-brick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during
                the
                reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both
                Islamic
                and Hindu motifs. Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid
                Persian
                floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great
                Mughal
                Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, Lahore
                Fort
                was used as the residence of Emperor Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire. To see the location of

                There are various stories regarding its construction. According to the sources Nawab Sir Sadiq Abbasi
                built the
                Palace for himself.
                <br>
                <br>
                Noor Mehal is one of the hidden gems of Bahawalpur, due to the lack of publicity. The palace is open to
                public.
                It is currently in the possession of the Pakistan Army and is used as a state guest house for holding
                state
                durbars and meetings with foreign delegations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mr. Heennan, an Englishman who was the state engineer, designed the building. The foundation of Noor
                Palace was
                laid in 1872. A map and coins of the state were buried in its foundation as a good omen. Most of the
                palace's
                materials and furniture were imported from England and Italy. The construction of the palace was
                completed in
                1875 at a cost of Rs. 1.2 million. Considering the amount of silver in the Indian Rupee Coin at 11.66
                Grams in
                1862, this amount in 2016 would come to about 8.1 million US dollars. Noor Palace covers an area of
                44,600
                square feet (4,140 m <sup>2</sup> ). It has 32 rooms including 14 in the basement, 6 verandas and 5
                domes.

                The Wazir Khan Mosque is a 17th-century mosque located in the city of Lahore, capital of the Pakistani
                province
                of Punjab. The mosque was commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a part of an
                ensemble of buildings that also included the nearby Shahi Hammam baths. Construction of Wazir Khan
                Mosque began
                in 1634 C.E., and was completed in 1641. It is on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. Considered
                to be the
                most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque, Wazir Khan Mosque is renowned for its intricate faience tile
                work
                known as kashi-kari, as well as its interior surfaces that are almost entirely embellished with
                elaborate
                Mughal-era frescoes. The mosque has been under extensive restoration since 2009 under the direction of
                the Aga
                Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab, with contributions from the governments of Germany,
                Norway,
                and the United States. To see the location of Masjid Wazir Khan <a
