        Khyber Pakhtunkhwa commonly
        abbreviated as KP or KPK, is one of the four provinces of Pakistan. Located in the northwestern region of the
        country, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the smallest province of Pakistan by land area and the third-largest province by
        population after Punjab and Sindh. It shares land borders with the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the
        south, Punjab to the south-east and province of Gilgit-Baltistan to the north and north-east, as well as
        Islamabad Capital Territory to the east, Autonomous Territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to the north-east. It
        shares an international border with Afghanistan to the west. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is known as a tourist hot spot
        for adventurers and explorers and has a varied landscape ranging from rugged mountain ranges, valleys, plains
        surrounded by hills, undulating submontane areas and dense agricultural farms.
        <br>
        <br>
        While it is the third-largest Pakistani province in terms of both its population and its economy, it is
        geographically the smallest. The province is home to 17.9 percent of Pakistan's total population, with the
        majority of its inhabitants being Pashtuns. Within Pakistan, K. Pakhtunkhwa borders Punjab, Balochistan, the
        Islamabad Capital Territory, and the Pakistani-administered territories of Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Jammu and
        Kashmir.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once a stronghold of Buddhism, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the site of the ancient region of Gandhara, including the
        ruins of the Gandharan capital of Pushkalavati (located near modern-day Charsadda). The region's history is
        characterized by frequent invasions by various empires, largely due to its geographical proximity to the
        historically important Khyber Pass.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although it is colloquially known by a variety of other names, the name "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" was brought into
        effect for the North-West Frontier Province in April 2010, following the passing of the 18th Constitutional
        Amendment. On 2 March 2017, the Pakistani government considered a proposal for a merger of the adjoining
        Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as well as a repealing of the Frontier Crimes
        Regulation, which Pakistan had inherited following the partition of British India in 1947. However, some
        political parties opposed the merger, and instead called for the FATA to be reorganized as a separate
        province. However, on 24 May 2018, the National Assembly of Pakistan voted in favour of the 25th
        Constitutional Amendment, which would merge the FATA as well as the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas with
        Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa subsequently approved the bill on 28 May
        2018; it was signed into law on 31 May by erstwhile Pakistani president Mamnoon Hussain, which officially
        completed the administrative merger process.

                The Khyber Pass is a mountain pass in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, on the border with
                Afghanistan. It connects the town of Landi Kotal to the Valley of Peshawar at Jamrud by traversing part
                of the
                Spin Ghar mountains. Since it was part of the ancient Silk Road, it has been a vital trade route between
                Central
                Asia and the Indian subcontinent and a strategic military choke point for various states that controlled
                it.
                Following Asian Highway 1, the summit of the pass at Landi Kotal is five kilometres inside Pakistan,
                descending
                460 m to Jamrud, about 30 km from the Afghan border. The inhabitants of the area are predominantly from
                the
                Afridi and Shinwari tribes of Pashtuns. To see the location of Khyber Pass <a

                Swat District is a district in the Malakand Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. With a population
                of
                2,309,570 per the 2017 national census, Swat is the 15th-largest district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
                province. Swat
                District is centered on the Valley of Swat, usually referred to simply as Swat, which is a natural
                geographic
                region surrounding the Swat River. The valley was a major centre of early Buddhism under the ancient
                kingdom of
                Gandhara, and was a major centre of Gandharan Buddhism, with pockets of Buddhism persisting in the
                valley until
                the 10th century, after which the area became largely Muslim. Until 1969, Swat was part of the Yusafzai
                State of
                Swat, a self-governing princely state that was inherited by Pakistan following its independence from
                British
                rule. The region was seized by the Tehrik-i-Taliban in late-2007 until Pakistani control was
                re-established in
                mid-2009. The average elevation of Swat is 980 m, resulting in a considerably cooler and wetter climate
                compared
                to the rest of Pakistan. With lush forests, verdant alpine meadows, and snow-capped mountains, Swat is
                one of
                the country's most popular tourist destinations. To see the location of Swat <a

                Bala Hissar , also spelt Bala Hisar, is a historic fortress located in
                Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. First mentioned by 7th-century explorer Xuanzang, the fort was
                used as a
                royal residence for the Durrani Empire since 1747, when the Afghan king, Ahmad Shah Durrani, conquered
                Peshawar.
                The Marathas briefly occupied it after capturing Peshawar in 1758 but it was soon retaken by the
                Afghans. The
                Sikhs destroyed and reconstructed the fort after capturing Peshawar in March 1823. In 1849, the British
                East
                India Company reconstructed the fort's outer walls.
                <br>
                <br>
                The fort now serves as headquarters for Pakistan's Frontier Corps.
                <br>
                <br>
                The word Bālā Hissār is from Dari Persian, meaning "elevated or high fort." According to historian
                Hussain Khan, this name was given by the Afghan Emperor Timur Shah Durrani. To see the location of Bala Hisar Fort <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/d1L1PbVpRQjNCB3f7"
