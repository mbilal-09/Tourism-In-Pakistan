        Mohatta Palace, a museum in Karachi built in 1927 by Shivratan Chandraratan Mohatta a Hindu Marwari businessman.
        At Partition of Sub-continent in 1947, Mohatta Palace was acquired by the newly established Government of
        Pakistan to house its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Frere Hall is one of the finest architecture of the
        British Colonial Era which is one of the most significant tourists spot in Karachi. The Hall was built by Sir
        Henry Bartle Frere and was initiated in 1863 and the construction process was accomplished in 2 years in
        1865. Faiz Mahal is also a palace situated in Khairpur, Sindh. It was built in 1798 by Mir Sohrab Khan who
        belongs to Talpur Family. It is an example of architectural excellence, a world apart from today's stone-washed
        structures, is undeniable.

                Mazar-e-Quaid is the resting place of Muhammad Ali Jinnah situated in Karachi, Sindh. The marble
                monument
                comprises a surface area of 3,100 square metres. It is surrounded by formal gardens and designed in an
                Islamic
                modernist style. Following Jinnah's death in 1948, his tomb was capped by a small dome and remained in
                poor
                conditions. In 1957, the Government of Pakistan held an international competition for the design of the
                mausoleum. The design of the victorious William Whitfield attained prominent distinction, though his
                work was
                rejected by Jinnah's sister Fatima. She sought the support of the public and subsequently approved the
                design of
                Jinnah's close friend Yahya Merchant in 1960. The mausoleum's construction concluded in 1971 and was
                inaugurated
                by Yahya Khan, the then-president of Pakistan. Mazar-e-Quaid is regarded as one of the iconic monuments
                of
                Pakistan. Along with Jinnah, it entombs several other activists of the Pakistan Movement, making it a
                common
                place for celebrations of the Independence Day in the country. To see the location of Mazar-e-Quaid

                Mohenjo-daro is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built around 2500 BCE, it was
                the
                largest settlement of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major
                cities,
                contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico.
                With an
                estimated population of at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered until around 1700 BCE.
                Mohenjo-daro was
                abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not
                rediscovered
                until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was
                designated a
                UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, the first site in South Asia to be so designated. The site is
                currently
                threatened by erosion and improper restoration. To see the location of Mohenjo-Daro <a

                The Shah Jahan Mosque, also known as the Jamia Masjid of Thatta, is a 17th-century building that serves
                as the
                central mosque for the city of Thatta, in the Pakistani province of Sindh. The mosque is considered to
                have the
                most elaborate display of tile work in South Asia, and is also notable for its geometric brick work - a
                decorative element that is unusual for Mughal-period mosques. It was built during the reign of Mughal
                emperor
                Shah Jahan, who bestowed it to the city as a token of gratitude, and is heavily influenced by Central
                Asian
                architecture - a reflection of Shah Jahan's campaigns near Samarkand shortly before the mosque was
                designed.
