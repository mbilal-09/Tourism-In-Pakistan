        Major tourist attractions in Pakistan include the ruin of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, the Himalayan hill stations.
        Pakistan is home to several mountain peaks over 7,000 metres (23,000 feet), including K2, which draw adventurers
        and mountaineers from around the world. The north of Pakistan has many old fortresses, ancient architecture and
        the Hunza and Chitral valleys, which are home to small Kalash communities and Fairy Meadows, and the Diamer
        District of Gilgit Baltistan. Punjab province has the historic city Lahore, Pakistan's cultural capital, with
        many examples of Mughal architecture such as Badshahi Masjid, Shalimar Gardens, Tomb of Jahangir and Lahore
        Fort.

        Along with Afghanistan Pakistan continues to be on extended international travel restrictions advisory of WHO
        due to yet to be achieved satisfactory level of polio immunization and concern of international spread of the
        polio decease again.

        According to Samira Shackle, Pakistan during the 1960s was part of the famous “hippy trail” stretching from
        Europe to Asia. But that tourism disappeared in the 1970s with the conversion from a liberal government to an
        Islamized Pakistan under dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Due to subsequent Taliban and al-Qaeda influence,
        especially after the September 11 attacks, westerners became the target of local branches of those terror
        organizations. Shackle says even domestic tourism came to a halt due to terrorism which - as of 2018 - has
        taken the lives of more than 65,000 in Pakistan since the year 2001.
